# ANE-GPT
- Optimizations and improvements based on Apple's project ["ML-ANE-Transformers"](https://github.com/Apple/ml-ane-transformers).
- The adaptation of the GPT-2 model in ANE will be carried out later in the project.
- In the original official example I made a slight modification to make it a model of GPT-2 architecture,
and can be optimized and accelerated on the ANE engine.
